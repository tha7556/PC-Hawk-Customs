<br/>CSC 455 Database Design and CSC 450 Software Engineering Project.
<br/>Implemented a virtual store for buying parts to build a pc in C#. Takes parts from PC Part Picker to set up the database. Then the frontend takes that information to provide a ui to build and order a computer. Unfortunately doesn't work outside of the UNCW campus as it is a local server.
